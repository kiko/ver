=  Welcome to VER, the Vim & Emacs in Ruby editor  =
====================================================

This project can be found at: http://github.com/manveru/ver

Quick intro:

VER is a modal editor, drawing from both Emacs and Vim for inspiration, as they are both excellent projects but have very different downsides.
I tried to address these downsides:

  * Use of a real programming language (Ruby) for implementation, configuration
    and scripting (no ancient elisp or crazy vimscript)
  * Easy to use keymappings to emulate other editors while maintaining the
    strength of a live environment.
  * I don't intend this editor to be everything for everybody, it's just useful
    for myself for now.
  * Make editing powerful without years of learning and remembering arcane
    shortcuts, and don't require users of the editor to sacrifice their wrists.
  * Allow project-based browsing and grepping right from the start.
  * Easily identify the mode you are in by looking at the color of the status
    line and cursor.

Currently working:

  * [C-x] : Eval a line of ruby
  * [C-e] : Eval current line and output result below
  * Buffers
    * [C-s] : Save buffer contents to file
  * Opening new buffers
    * [M-o] : Fuzzy file browser (only use for projects)
    * [C-o] : Normal file browser (fast for anything, but less magic)
    * [C-g] : Grep browser, grep all files and jump to matches
  * Switching buffers
    * [M-1] to [M-9] : Quick switching buffers
    * [M-b]          : Switching buffers by partial name
  * [C-q] : Exit current mode or close VER
  * [C-w] : Close current buffer (requires confirmation if buffer was modified)
  * Selection, Copy, Paste
    * Starting selection
      * [v]   : charwise
      * [V]   : linewise
      * [C-v] : blockwise
      * Once selection is active, you can switch between these selection modes
        with the same keys.
        So, if you started charwise selection but would like to select
        blockwise instead, just hit [C-v]
    * Copy to clipboard
      * [y] : copy current selection
      * [Y] : copy the full lines touched by current selection
    * Paste from clipboard
      * [p] : paste after current cursor position
      * [P] : paste before current cursor position
    * Indent
      * [>] : Indent selection
      * [<] : Unindent selection
    * Filter
      * [!] : Filter selection through external program
      * [M-e] : Eval selection and output result below
  * Syntax highlighting
    - No keys associated, the syntax is detected by filename extension for now.
    - Trailing newlines are highlighted by default.
  * Searching
    * [/] : Start searching by regular expression
    * [n] : Jump to next search result
    * [N] : Jump to previous search result
  * Indentation
    * [>] : Indent line
    * [<] : Unindent line
  * Movement
    * Basic
      * [j] : Line down
      * [k] : Line up
      * [h] : Char left
      * [l] : Char right
    * Jumps
      * [w] : Word right
      * [W] : Chunk right
      * [b] : Word left
      * [B] : Chunk left
      * [0] : Beginning of line
      * [$] : End of line
      * [G] : Last line
      * [g g] : First line
      * [C-f] or [npage] : One page down
      * [C-b] or [ppage] : One page up
      * [0 g], [50 g], [100 g], ... : Jump to given line
  * Completion
    * [tab]     : Last used completion, if first time it defaults to word completion
    * [C-x C-w] : Word completion
    * [C-x C-l] : Full line completion
    * [C-x C-f] : Filename completion
    * [C-x C-s] : spelling completion (needs aspell)


How to run VER:

First, make sure that you have the bin/ directory in your PATH.
On startup you can choose which keymap to use, VER currently ships with two: vi and diakonos. The vi mapping is the default.

  ver -k diakonos
  ver -k vi


Todo:

  - [M-s] : Save file under different name
  - [M-x] : Live ruby console (figure out some nice way)
  - Better configuration for tabs.
  - Easy runtime configuration
  - Replace that stops after receiving a single char
